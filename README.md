This is CuboidEngine, a voxel-based game engine I have been working on during the livestreams on my Twitch channel (twitch.tv/nonumberman). The engine is currently rendering with a gpu-based path tracer.

# How to build

1. Pull or download this repository to you machine.
2. Open the .sln file with Visual Studio 2019 or above.
3. Press run or build, and you should be good to go.
4. Contact me (info@nonumberstudios.com or https://discord.gg/NBeUtzFaq6) if you run into any issues.

# How to use

CuboidEngine is not published on Nuget yet. This means that you can only use the engine by creating a new c# application within the Cuboid solution. You can 'using Cuboid' and use the CEngine class to access all functionality. An example game has been provided with the solution.
